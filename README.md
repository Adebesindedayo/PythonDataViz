# Python Data Visualization using Matplotlib

## **About Me**

Erich Purpur

    Research Librarian for Science & Engineering

    Brown Science & Engineering Library room I046


I'm a part of a group called [research data services](https://data.library.virginia.edu/) and I do these things:
    
    1. Serve as Liaison to various engineering departments
    2. Teach workshops and classes (like this one)
    3. Help people with research projects
    4. Random other things as they come up
    

## **Matplotlib**
*Excerpt taken from [MatPlotLib's Website](https://matplotlib.org/):*
Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and 
interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the 
Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.

Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. You can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code.

*From [MatPlotLib's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matplotlib):*
Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications

## **Matplotlib History**
*From this [github blog](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/03/23/matplotlib-and-the-future-of-visualization-in-python/):*
Matplotlib was conceived by John Hunter in 2002, originally as a patch to IPython to enable interactive MATLAB-style plotting 
via the IPython command line. Version 0.1 of Matplotlib was released in 2003. It became the plotting package of choice by the 
Space Telescope Science Institute, which financially supported Matplotlib's development at that time. 

Matplotlib currently has a large, active developer base, and is now widely used in the scientific Python world. 
But, it is not the only data visualization tool available!

## **Other Data Viz tools for Python**

## **ggplot for python**
The ggplot python library evolved out of the ggplot2 R-specific package. It seems to be accepted that ggplot2 (in R) is a 
more sophisticated graphics tool and provides more high end functionality. It is not clear to me if ggplot for python integrates all the functionality that ggplot2 has in R. 

## **Seaborn**

Matplotlib is mainly used for basic plotting. Creates clean, publication-quality graphics. Also, built upon numpy and cleanly 
integrates pandas as a wrapper (2 common scientific packages)
